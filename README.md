<!-- EXERCISES -->
## Exercises:

- ####Exercise 1:
Knowing the number in mathematics PI œÄ, ask the user to enter the value of the radius of
a circle and calculate and display the area and perimeter on the screen.

- ####Exercise 2: 
Write a program that calculates the average price of a product. The average price is
must be calculated from the price of the same product in three different establishments.

- ####Exercise 3:
From a known number of meters that the user enters through the keyboard, the
You must obtain its equivalent in centimeters, in millimeters and in inches.

- ####Exercise 4:
Write a program that calculates how many liters of fuel a car consumed. The user will enter a number of liters of fuel loaded at the station and a
number of kilometers traveled, then the program will calculate the consumption (km/lt) and show it to the user.

- ####Exercise 5:
Write a program that allows the user to input the value of two numeric variables of
integer type. Later, the program must interchange the values of both variables
and display the final result on the screen. For example, if the user enters the values num1 = 9 and num2 = 3, the output a of the program should display: num1 = 3 and num2 = 9
