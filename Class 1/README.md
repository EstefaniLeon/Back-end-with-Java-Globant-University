<!-- EXERCISES -->
## Exercises:

- #### Activity 1 - Exercise 1:
We are going to make the character perform a series of actions. The instructions to perform the actions and the order of the actions will be given through commands. We will generate a list of commands for the character to perform precise actions.

- #### Activity 3 - Exercise 2:
Write a program that asks for a name. The program will read the name of a teammate.
teammate. To do this we must ask our team for the name of the teammate that and display his or her name on the screen, along with the following message: Variable, "is the one who collaborated the most in my team, fostering cooperation and flow of
knowledge. For these reasons, we are going to RECOGNIZE him/her by giving him/her a PULSE".

- #### Activity 3 - Exercise 3:
Write an algorithm in which the user is asked how is today's day?
(sunny, cloudy, raining). Then display on the screen a message stating.
"Today is ...", completing the message with the data entered by the user.
