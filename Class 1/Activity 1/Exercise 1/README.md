##Objective:
We are going to make the character perform a series of actions. The instructions to perform the actions and the order of the actions will be given through commands. We will generate a list of commands for the character to perform precise actions.

##Modality:

##Proposed resolution time:
45 minutes.

##Suggested tasks:
- Get the kitten to do 3 laps around the screen.
