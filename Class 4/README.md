- #### Activity 3 - Exercise 6:
In the middle of the internal audit, the team is covering for a co-worker who is on leave. Your co-worker has left a message with the tasks to be performed. "Hi! Thank you very much for covering for me. The main thing you need to do is to complete the monthly revenue income spreadsheet. You can do this by looking up the latest advertising revenue in the marketing reports. After you've done all that, check my email and if there are less than than 10 unread emails check my voicemail to see if there are any requests from executives. If there are such requests, do them first unless I have an emergency request from another department. Once you're done with the compliance request, water the plant off my desk after shutting down the computer. Oh, wait, I should have mentioned a couple of things: you must log in as an administrator to see the marketing reports, and you'll need to send me a marketing reports, and you'll need to send me an email update right after you're done handling the requests. Well, thanks again - that's very helpful! I owe you lunch when I get back."
Our task will be to print the list of tasks on the screen in the correct order so that we can do them later.
