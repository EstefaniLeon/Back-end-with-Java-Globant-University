<!-- EXERCISES -->
## Exercises:

- #### Activity 1 - Exercise 1:
Ask the user to enter the base and height of a rectangle, and calculate and display the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
area = base * height.
perimeter = 2 * height + 2 * base.

- #### Activity 1 - Exercise 2: 
Write a program that calculates the volume of a cylinder. To do this, the user must be asked to enter the radius and height. Display the result on the screen.
volume = π * radius2 * height

- #### Activity 1 - Exercise 3: 
From a known number of days that the user enters on the keyboard, write a program to convert the days into hours, minutes and seconds. For example:
1 day = 24 hours = 1440 minutes = 86400 seconds.

- #### Activity 1 - Exercise 4: 
Create a program that prompts the user to enter the price of a product at the beginning of the year, and the price of the same product at the end of the year.The program should calculate what was the percentage increase of that product during the year and display it on the screen.

- #### Activity 1 - Exercise 5: 
A school wants to know what percentage of boys and what percentage of girls are in the current class. Design an algorithm for this purpose. Remember that to calculate the percentage you can make a simple rule of 3. The program should prompt the user to enter the total number of boys, and the total number of girls in the class.

- #### Activity 2: 
Enter a 3-digit number and display the quality, ten and hundred.

For example, if the number entered on the screen is 123 the program should display:

HUNDRED: 1
TENTH: 2
UNIT: 3

- #### Activity 4 - Exercise 1:
Write a program that asks the user for his name, and then greets him.

- #### Activity 4 - Exercise 9:
A salesperson receives a base salary plus an extra 10% commission from their sales, the
seller wants to know how much money he will get in commissions for all three
sales you make in the month and the total you will receive in the month taking into account your
Base salary and commissions.

- #### Activity 4 - Exercise 11:
A student wants to know what his final grade will be in the subject of Algorithms. Bliss
rating is made up of the following percentages:
to. 55% of the average of their three partial qualifications.
b. 30% of the final exam grade.
c. 15% of the grade of a final work.

- #### Activity 4 - Exercise 13:
Write an algorithm that reads a number and shows its square root and its cube root.
PSeInt does not have any built-in function that allows you to calculate the cube root, how do you
can you calculate?
